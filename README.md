# Components and Closure functions
In this lab, we'll be creating an app that marks a course as featured.

**NOTE** This app uses [Pods](http://www.ember-cli.com/user-guide/#using-pods). 

The routes, models, and templates have been created for you. You'll need to finish up the controller and component actions.

When you're done with the tests, visit `http://localhost:4200/courses/1`
